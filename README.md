# Assignment
The whole github repository containes all the csv's provided for the analysis.
I have combined them into a single csv named as "combined"

Objective of the Assignment :
Analyzing the data sets to find popular dishes, order trends and cooking preferences
findings and Recommendations:
> the most popular dish among all are
> 1. Spaghetti
> 2. Grilled Chicken
> The Age group of 20-30 has more interest in Grilled Chicken dish followed by Spaghetti
> The most orders are being ordered in chicago compared to any other locations.
> The Customer also gives high rating to grilled chicken dish, but in some cases it takes 40 mins and sometimes 45min. So it should hold onto a specific amount of time.
> The age group of 20-30 orders most among all the age groups and also spends the most amount. The average amount spend among this age group is 9.0 USD
> Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, are the three main cities which has more active orders. Miami, Boston, Austin has less so I feel these areas should add more items to make them have more orders.
Tech Stack:
> Python
> Pandas
> Matplotlib
> Seaborn
> NumPy
> Jupyter Notebook
